I also included the drivers and jar files here in the Images folder.

For mysql create first the database in php myadmin and name it as "bernadez_hims"
then create the table name "users".


If errors occur, resolve the problem by adding those jar files inside the Images folder 
and if it needs "beans-binding library" just add new library and name it as "beans-binding".

Note that this is from my previous java project that is why there lot of other files other
than the login and registration form which was the only required in this activity.
